LibNeubot 2.0.0 [2014-04-11]
	* Add Android.mk to compile a static library for Android
	* Remove the unused LibNeubot.java/gen_java thing
	* Reimplement NeubotPollable using C++ and write C wrappers to
	  provide a similar API (however, the arguments of the constructor
	  and of attach() were changed, hence the API bump)
	* Move Java code that was autogenerated with SWIG into the
	  neubot/neubot_android repository
	* Make sure gen_cxx generates code that works on Android: correct
	  the order of the generated classes, replace the nonworking cast with
          the invocation of the ->pointer() method
	* Unify gen_py/gen_python and libneubot.py/libneubot1.py: now
	  gen_python generates a libneubot.py file that contains the old
	  stuff plus the stuff that was in libneubot1.py, moreover, the
	  gen_py script and libneubot1.py were removed
	* Regen libneubot_python
	* Make sure shared C functions (e.g., log.h and utils.h) are
	  correctly exported to C++
	* While bumping the API, unbreak the resolve() API
	* While touching the Pollable, reimplement timeouts using
	  the support provided by libevent
	* Realize that the destruction of objects must flow from the
	  derived classes to the base classes (as C++ does) not the
	  other way round (as PyNeubot does)
	* Add some defines needed to compile on Android
	* Export the logs to the logcat to ease the debugging

LibNeubot 1.0.1 [2014-02-18]
	* Tweak gen_cxx to generate code that SWIG can handle
	* Use SWIG to generate Java and Python wrappers

LibNeubot 1.0.0 [2013-12-15]
	* Return status_t in NeubotPoller_defer_{read,write}
	* Pass opaque, not pollable, to NeubotPollable callbacks
	* libneubot.json: Add and use hooks, slots and __destructor__
	* Add easier-to-use libneubot1.py wrappers
	* Add neubot.hh, wrappers for C++

LibNeubot 0.1.0 [2013-12-12]
	* Initial release
